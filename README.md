# car-etl-report
This project contains a project that queries the NHTSA for annual crashes on specific vehicles that the user would like to see

More I would like to know the average rate of crashes my Honda Fit receives in a time frameðŸ˜Š

# Tech Stack
My hopeful plan is to have...
1. Front End(A live service that pulls data from the API to then present to the user?) 
   1. React/JS
   2. HTML/CSS
2. Back-End
   1. GCP(DataFlow and Cloud Storage and BigQuery?)
   2. Terraform(GCP provisioning)
   3. Apache Beam
   4. Java(???)
   5. GHA(For testing capabilities)
